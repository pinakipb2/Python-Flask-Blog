I do not hold any kind of copyright for the design of the templates. I only modified the templates accordingly to suit the flask framework and made a full upscale and productive and customised website ready to launch.


Below are website URLs from where I have taken the templates from :
1) Main Website - https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/demo/devblog/
2) Contact Form - https://colorlib.com/etc/cf/ContactFrom_v1/index.html
3) Admin Panel - https://colorlib.com/etc/lf/Login_v1/index.html
4) Dashboard - https://colorlib.com/polygon/cooladmin/index.html
5) Registration Form - https://colorlib.com/etc/regform/colorlib-regform-5/


The templates are customised in Flask framework. Neither the templates nor the images are owned by me.
